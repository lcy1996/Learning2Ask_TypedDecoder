## Usage:
### Environment Setting
To run the codes, you should use python-2.7 and tensorflow-1.0.

### STD:
Command ```python main.py {--[option1]=[value1] --[option2]=[value2] ... }```

Options(=[default_value]):
* ```--is_train=True``` Set to True for training and False from inference.
* ```--symbols=20000``` Size of vocabulary.
* ```--embed_units=100``` Size of word embedding.
* ```--units=512``` Size of each model layer.
* ```--layers=4``` Number of layers in the model.
* ```--batch_size=50``` Batch size to use during training. 
* ```--data_dir=./data``` Data directory.
* ```--train_dir=./train``` Training directory.
* ```--per_checkpoint=1000``` How many steps to do per checkpoint.
* ```--check_version=0``` The version for continuing training or for inferencing. Set to 0 if you don't want to continue from an existed checkpoint.
* ```--log_parameters=True``` Set to True to show the parameters.
* ```--inference_path=""``` Set filename of inference, empty for screen input.
* ```--PMI_path=./PMI``` PMI directory.
* ```--keywords_per_sentence=20``` How many keywords will be included. We don't need to set this flag in STD.
* ```--question_data=True``` **(Deprecated, please set to True)** An unused option in the final version.

The file ```train.sh``` and ```infer.sh``` contain example commands for training and inference. You can use them with the ```sh``` command.

### HTD:
Command ```python main.py {--[option1]=[value1] --[option2]=[value2] ... }```

Options(=[default_value]):
* ```--is_train=True``` Set to True for training and False from inference.
* ```--symbols=20000``` Size of vocabulary.
* ```--embed_units=100``` Size of word embedding.
* ```--units=512``` Size of each model layer.
* ```--layers=4``` Number of layers in the model.
* ```--batch_size=50``` Batch size to use during training. **Please set to 1 during inference or the PMI mechanism can't work properly.**
* ```--data_dir=./data``` Data directory.
* ```--train_dir=./train``` Training directory.
* ```--per_checkpoint=1000``` How many steps to do per checkpoint.
* ```--check_version=0``` The version for continuing training or for inferencing.
* ```--log_parameters=True``` Set to True to show the parameters.
* ```--inference_path=""``` Set filename of inference, empty for screen input.
* ```--PMI_path=./PMI``` PMI directory.
* ```--keywords_per_sentence=20``` How many keywords will be included.
* ```--question_data=True``` **(Deprecated, please set to True)** An unused option in the final version.
